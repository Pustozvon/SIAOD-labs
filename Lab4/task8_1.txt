Those that can see thou lov'st, and I am blind.

But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind:
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
When all my best doth worship thy defect,
That is so proud thy service to despise,
What merit do I in myself respect
Revenge upon myself with present moan?
Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn Upon?
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?
Am of myself, all tyrant for thy sake?
Do I not think on thee, when I forgot
When I against myself with thee partake?
Canst thou, Ðž cruel, say I love thee not,
